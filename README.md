# Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu
## Introduction
The project aims to analysis nutritional of McDonald's menu items. This analysis will help consumers make informed choices about their food selections at McDonald's and to understand the nutritional implications of their dietary decisions.
## Goal
The goal of this project are to provide insights into several key aspects of McDonald's menu nutrition and develop model machine learning to predict and analyze nutritional aspects of menu items. Additionally, through the implementation of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we seek to predict characteristics like whether an item is classified as 'Breakfast' based on its nutritional attributes. These models will not only provide predictive capabilities but also enable us to evaluate their performance through metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
