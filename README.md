# Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu
## Introduction
The project aims to analysis nutritional of McDonald's menu items. This analysis will help consumers make informed choices about their food selections at McDonald's and to understand the nutritional implications of their dietary decisions.
## Goal
The goal of this project are to provide insights into several key aspects of McDonald's menu nutrition and develop model machine learning to predict and analyze nutritional aspects of menu items. Additionally, through the implementation of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we seek to predict characteristics like whether an item is classified as 'Breakfast' based on its nutritional attributes. These models will not only provide predictive capabilities but also enable us to evaluate their performance through metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
## Step-by-Step Process
**1. Data Loading**
  * Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
    
**2. Data Cleaning**
  * Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
  * Correct any data type issues if present.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
  * Frequency counts for categorical columns.
  * Visualizations:
      * Distribution of calories, fat, and other nutritional information.
      * Comparison of nutritional values across different items.

**4. Feature Engineering**
  * Create new features if needed (e.g., fat-to-calories ratio).
    
**5. Statistical Analysis**
  * Correlation analysis to see relationships between different nutritional components.

**6. Modeling**
  * Create a predictive model using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN

**7. Evaluation**
  * Evaluate the models using the testing dataset and determine the most effective model by analyzing metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has provided valuable insight into the nutritional composition of McDonald's menu items. Through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning modeling, we gain a deeper understanding of the calories, fat, protein and other nutritional aspects of the menu. By following these steps, nutritional content trends across menu categories can be identified, highlighted the impact of ingredient choices on overall nutrition, and developed predictive models to classify menu items based on their nutritional profiles.
