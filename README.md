# Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu
## Introduction
The project aims to analysis nutritional of McDonald's menu items. This analysis will help consumers make informed choices about their food selections at McDonald's and to understand the nutritional implications of their dietary decisions.
## Goal
The goal of this project are to provide insights into several key aspects of McDonald's menu nutrition and develop model machine learning to predict and analyze nutritional aspects of menu items. Additionally, through the implementation of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we seek to predict characteristics like whether an item is classified as 'Breakfast' based on its nutritional attributes. These models will not only provide predictive capabilities but also enable us to evaluate their performance through metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
## Step-by-Step Process
**1. Data Loading**
  * Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
    
**2. Data Cleaning**
  * Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
  * Correct any data type issues if present.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
  * Frequency counts for categorical columns.
  * Visualizations:
      * Distribution of calories, fat, and other nutritional information.
      * Comparison of nutritional values across different items.
